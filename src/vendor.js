/**
 * This file contains references to the vendor libraries we are using in this project. This is used by webpack in the production buildonly. A seperate bundle for the vendor code is useful since it is unlikely to change as often as the applications code. All the libraries we reference here will be written to vendor.js so they can be cached until one of them change.
